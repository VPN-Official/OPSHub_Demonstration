Frontend Functional Specification — OpsHub (frontend-only, Phase 1, segregation of concerns)

⸻

1 — High-level grounding (source & scope)
	•	Frontend implements the PWA, mobile & desktop UI surfaces for the core Phase-1 modules: Pulse, SmartQueue, WorkItem Detail, Intelligence Center, Schedule, Notifications.  ￼
	•	Mobile-first PWA with 4-hour offline support, installable, push notifications; parity of core flows (triage, act, create incident, approve low-risk).  ￼
	•	Frontend is an overlay — it reads from systems of record (ITSM, monitoring) and writes back actions via APIs; offline writes must be queued and WAL-style synced.  ￼

⸻

2 — Segregation of concerns (top level)

I split frontend responsibilities into independent layers/components so teams can implement, test and ship concurrently.
	1.	Presentation / UI Layer (Components & Pages)
	•	React/Vue/Solid components (design system): layout, grids, widgets, forms, lists/cards, modals, toasts, badges, icons, skeleton loaders.
	•	Pages / route surfaces:
	•	Pulse (persona variant views)
	•	SmartQueue (tabs: My Work / Team / Knowledge / Approvals)
	•	WorkItem Detail (header + tab panels: Details, Activity, System Logs, Approvals, Communications, Attachments)
	•	Intelligence Center (Automations, AI Adoption, Knowledge, Approvals analytics)
	•	Schedule (day/week/month/timeline)
	•	Notifications Inbox (All / Critical / Grouped / Suppressed / Nudges)
	•	Sync & Conflict Center (pending offline actions + arbitration UI)
	•	Mobile-specific screens (compact card view, mobile WorkItem, quick create incident)
	•	UI responsibilities: accessibility (WCAG AA), internationalization, theming, responsive behavior, touch optimizations.
	2.	State Management Layer (Client state / UI state)
	•	Local UI state (component-level): ephemeral UI (modals, form drafts).
	•	Shared client state store (e.g., Redux/Pinia/MobX etc.): user session, persona, selected filters, queue pages, cached WorkItem objects, offline action queue metadata, sync status.
	•	Derived state: SmartScore sorting, SLA countdown transforms, filtered lists for drilldowns, explainability meta.
	•	State invariants: SLA timers shown live (never pause in UI) and must match server timestamps (see sync rules).
	3.	Network / Data Layer (API contracts, caching, adapters)
	•	API adapter / repository pattern that exposes typed methods:
	•	getPulseWidgets(filters), getSmartQueue(filters, cursor), getWorkItem(id), postWorkItemUpdate(id, patch), runAutomation(id, automationId), getNotifications(cursor), ackNotification(id) etc.
	•	HTTP + WebSocket for real-time events & streaming (notifications, live SLA updates, automation progress).
	•	Cache strategy:
	•	Read-through cache for lists and WorkItems (local IndexedDB).
	•	Background refresh: open WorkItem should load cached version instantly, then fetch diffs. Performance target: WorkItem open time ≤1.5s with cache.  ￼
	4.	Offline / Sync Layer (critical and distinct)
	•	Write-Ahead Log (WAL) persisted in IndexedDB: each user action (assign, comment, approve, run low-risk automation request, create incident) is an immutable action record (GUID, timestamp, device id, actor). Actions are queued and attempted in priority order.  ￼
	•	Sync engine responsibilities:
	•	Exponential backoff, partial success handling (per-action success/failure markers), priority uploads (critical approvals first), forced sync after 4h offline.  ￼
	•	Conflict detection during sync: if remote changed same field, surface to Sync & Conflict Center with AI suggestion and require user arbitration. All arbitration choices are audit-logged with device id and reason.  ￼
	•	Offline UX:
	•	Visual indicators: offline badge, queued action counter, per-item sync state, optimistic UI for safe operations (but mark as “pending”).
	•	Sync & Conflict Center: list of pending items, conflicts with “AI suggestion” and accept/override controls.
	5.	Security & Auth Layer (client aspects)
	•	SSO + token flow: SAML/OAuth handshake on first login, device registration step (store device fingerprint), MFA required for privileged actions (approvals, automation triggers). Device revocation support (app polls for revocation and forces logout/wipes cache).  ￼
	•	Client must respect field-level masking and copy/paste restrictions for sensitive fields. Encryption of local storage and secure key handling per tenant.
	6.	AI UX Layer (explainability & interactive flows)
	•	All AI recommendations in UI include: confidence %, top 3 contributing factors, model version, and a compact “Why?” panel (consistent across SmartQueue, WorkItem sidebar, Approval advisor and Pulse widgets).  ￼
	•	Controls: accept / reject / ask for more context. Rejection must open a mandatory reason field that gets recorded locally (and later sent in sync). The frontend enforces these UI flows and records metadata for training.  ￼
	7.	Telemetry & Audit (client telemetry)
	•	Send UI telemetry (events) to OpsHub telemetry pipeline: page views, action attempts, offline durations, sync success/failures, conflict rates, mobile battery impact signals for Intelligence Center metrics. Follow the spec targets for mobile telemetry.  ￼

4 — API surface & contracts (frontend expectations)

Frontend must own contracts (documented JSON shapes) for the calls it depends on — backend teams commit to these.

Minimal set (examples — exact schemas in API spec):
	•	GET /api/v1/pulse?persona=engineer → widgets[] (id, type, value, explainability?)
	•	GET /api/v1/smartqueue?tab=mywork&cursor=abc → {items[], cursor}
	•	GET /api/v1/workitems/{id} → full WorkItem payload (fields, attachments, relatedIDs, slaDeadline, smartScore, aiRecommendations[])
	•	POST /api/v1/workitems/{id}/actions → action record (type, payload) returns actionGUID
	•	POST /api/v1/sync/batch → accepts WAL batch, returns per-action result
	•	WS /events → push notifications (event, workItemId, severity, payload)
	•	GET /api/v1/ai/explain/{recId} → {confidence, factors[], modelVersion}

Frontend contract rules
	•	All requests include tenant id & device id.
	•	Server returns canonical timestamps (UTC). Frontend calculates SLA countdown client-side using server time origin to avoid clock drift.
	•	Error responses include well-known error codes (CONFLICT_FIELD, AUTH_REVOKED, WAL_SCHEMA_MISMATCH) so the client can show specific remediation flows.

(These contracts are implied by the spec’s integration and data flows).  ￼

⸻

5 — Offline & conflict UX details (flows)
	•	Action Queueing: any mutating action done offline becomes an action entry with optimistic UI update and shown as “pending” until sync result. Critical approvals are prioritized for upload when reconnecting.  ￼
	•	Conflict detection: server returns conflict metadata per field; frontend shows side-by-side “local vs remote” with AI suggestion and Accept Local / Accept Remote / Merge choices. All choices require optional reason (if acceptance of a conflict is a governance step — manager only). Immutably log the decision along with device id.  ￼
	•	Partial success: for a WAL batch, show per-action success/fail. Requeue failed ones and surface persistent failures to Tenant Admin via UI alert and Intelligence Center telemetry.  ￼

⸻

6 — AI explainability & interaction UI (rules)
	•	Compact trust panel on every AI card: shows confidence %, top 3 contributing factors, model version, and “Why this matters” condensed sentence. Clicking expands detailed explainability + historical examples.  ￼
	•	Action controls:
	•	Low-risk & confidence >85%: UI permits one-click run (but still logs).  ￼
	•	60–85%: show “Recommend” with confirm dialog (human-in-loop).
	•	<60%: read-only insight (no action).
	•	Rejection UX: forcing a rejection reason modal with a structured dropdown + free text — collect data for the learning loop.  ￼

⸻

7 — Security & compliance UI responsibilities
	•	Enforce MFA prompts on privileged UI actions. Provide device registration UX and a device list view (for Tenant Admins) that shows device fingerprint, last sync, status, and a remote revoke button.  ￼
	•	Respect field-level masking flags sent by API (the UI must not render sensitive fields unless allowed by role).
	•	Present suppression log viewer for notifications (immutable records, recovery action).

⸻

8 — Performance, accessibility & reliability targets
	•	Mobile: initial load ≤3s on simulated 3G; list navigation ≤1s; WorkItem open ≤1.5s with cached data. Telemetry to measure offline session durations and sync success rates.  ￼
	•	Accessibility: WCAG AA minimum; keyboard nav for all interactive elements; screen reader labels on AI explainability and SLA timers.
	•	Reliability: sync retries/backoff, graceful degraded mode (read-only views when critical failures).

⸻

9 — Testing strategy (frontend)
	•	Unit tests for components and state transitions (simulate offline queueing, conflict resolution).
	•	Integration tests for data layer with mocked API & WAL scenarios (partial success, schema mismatch).
	•	E2E tests (mobile & desktop) validating main time-critical flows: create incident (online/offline), run low-risk automation, approve change, conflict arbitration.
	•	Accessibility tests (axe) and performance budgets (Lighthouse) in CI.
	•	Contract tests: validate API response shapes against frontend assumptions (can be automated with Pact or similar).  ￼

⸻

10 — Deliverables & acceptance criteria (Phase 1)

For each module (Pulse, SmartQueue, WorkItem, Intelligence, Schedule, Notifications) deliver:
	1.	Component library + Storybook stories for all major components.
	2.	Pages implemented responsive and accessible.
	3.	Offline WAL implementation with IndexedDB persistence and sync engine (per spec: 4h offline guarantee).  ￼

1) Pulse — Operational cockpit

What it does (purpose)
Pulse is the read-only, role-based dashboard that surfaces governed KPIs and AI/automation impact; it’s the executive & persona landing page and drill-down launchpad.  ￼

Primary functions
	•	Role-specific KPI widgets (engineer, manager, SRE, SME, exec).
	•	AI/Automation attribution (e.g., “hours saved”, “$ downtime avoided”).
	•	Drill-downs into SmartQueue or Intelligence Center while preserving filter context.
	•	Lightweight gamification (SLA streaks, “AI helped me” counters) with guardrails (no leaderboards).  ￼

Who cares / importance
	•	Execs use Pulse to justify investment (ROI, downtime avoided). Managers & SREs use it to spot trends and escalate. It’s the single-pane “value” view that demonstrates OpsHub ROI.  ￼

Data flows (frontend expectations)
	•	Reads SLA, MTTR, downtime cost from monitoring/ITSM. Sends back AI attribution events to OpsHub storage (not authoritative systems).  ￼

Frontend UX responsibilities / acceptance
	•	Provide persona-specific layouts, drilldown links (preserve filter state), enforce read-only nature for Phase-1, show confidence/“why” for AI-derived KPIs, accessible charts and exportable snapshots for exec sharing. Pulse widgets must be cached for offline viewing.  ￼

⸻

2) SmartQueue — Unified, AI-prioritized work hub

What it does (purpose)
SmartQueue consolidates tasks from ITSM and alerts into one prioritized queue so engineers and managers see the right work at the right time. It is the main place users act.  ￼

Primary functions
	•	Presents all supported WorkItem types (incidents, requests, changes, maintenance, KB tasks, approvals).
	•	AI SmartScore (0–10) computed from SLA urgency, business impact, capacity, patterns; explains top 3 factors and confidence.
	•	Quick actions (assign, approve, run low-risk automation), bulk actions, and create-from-alert flows.  ￼

Who cares / importance
	•	Frontline engineers and dispatchers: reduces context switching, increases MTTR speed and field productivity. Managers use it for workload balancing and approvals. SmartQueue is where OpsHub converts visibility into action (highest operational throughput).  ￼

Data flows
	•	Pulls incidents/requests from ITSM (authoritative for those objects). Writes back assignments, approvals, statuses. UI must include optimistic updates + WAL queuing for offline writes.  ￼

Frontend UX responsibilities / acceptance
	•	List + card modes, SLA countdowns, explainable SmartScore popover, inline actions with pending state and per-item sync metadata. Offline: cached queue + create incident queued. Re-prioritization should animate/notify when SmartScore changes.  ￼

⸻

3) WorkItem Detail — The single source for incident/request context & act

What it does (purpose)
Shows full context for a single WorkItem: fields, activity stream, logs, AI recommendations, attachments, approvals — the place users read, decide and act.  ￼

Primary functions
	•	Canonical view of the WorkItem (metadata, SLA timer, activity, logs).
	•	AI sidebar with triage, RCA, automation suggestions and explainability.
	•	Action panel for assign, add comment, run automation, approve.
	•	Attachment capture (mobile camera), streaming back automation output (e.g., humanoid confirmation).  ￼

Who cares / importance
	•	Engineers for troubleshooting and resolution, SREs for RCA, SMEs for knowledge capture. This page’s UX quality directly impacts MTTR and successful automation adoption.  ￼

Data flows
	•	Pulls logs from monitoring, related records from ITSM/HR/service DB. Writes comments, assignment updates, approval decisions back to ITSM via OpsHub sync. Must show real-time updates (WS) and reconcile conflicts at field level on sync.  ￼

Frontend UX responsibilities / acceptance
	•	Instant cached open (then background diff), live SLA timer from server time, clearly labeled AI recs with confidence + “why”, optimistic UI for actions marked pending, attachments queued when offline, and conflict resolution UI when sync finds remote edits.  ￼

⸻

4) Intelligence Center — Learn, measure, and improve

What it does (purpose)
Aggregates telemetry, automation execution logs, adoption metrics and creates operational insights, ROI dashboards and nudges for improvements. It’s the “learning loop” and governance analytics surface.  ￼

Primary functions
	•	Automation ROI dashboards (downtime avoided, rollback %).
	•	AI adoption metrics, nudges list (automation candidates).
	•	Knowledge effectiveness reports and KB lifecycle metrics.
	•	Sends nudges back to SmartQueue to create automation tasks.  ￼

Who cares / importance
	•	SREs, managers, execs — shows business value of automations and AI; drives continuous improvement and adoption. Intelligence Center is the reporting backbone for demonstrating success to stakeholders.  ￼

Data flows
	•	Pulls execution logs from automation subsystems and OpsHub telemetry (SLA breaches, AI accepts/rejects). Writes nudges and actionable items into SmartQueue.  ￼

Frontend UX responsibilities / acceptance
	•	Interactive charts, filterable ROI tables, drilldown to underlying WorkItems, and UX to approve/snooze nudges. Show model versions and audit trails for governance. Must surface mobile health metrics (sync errors, battery impact).  ￼

⸻

5) Schedule — Resourcing & change visibility

What it does (purpose)
Shows shift schedules, planned changes, and resource conflicts; used for dispatching, capacity planning and preventing schedule-related SLA impacts.  ￼

Primary functions
	•	Calendar views (day/week/month), drag-and-drop shift editing, conflict detection and notes/comments on conflicts.
	•	Correlates HR shift data with ITSM change windows.  ￼

Who cares / importance
	•	Managers/dispatchers for shift assignment and to avoid scheduling conflicts that can impact SLAs. Important for planning and ensuring coverage for critical services.  ￼

Data flows
	•	Pulls shifts from HR systems, changes from ITSM; writes conflict notes back. Frontend must reconcile local edits and show conflicts in Sync & Conflict Center for arbitration.  ￼

Frontend UX responsibilities / acceptance
	•	Drag/drop scheduling UI with inline validation, conflict highlight, and mandatory reason capture for overrides. Support offline edits queued for sync and server-side conflict merges.  ￼

⸻

6) Notifications — Event funnel & action surface

What it does (purpose)
Aggregates events from sources (monitoring, ITSM, email) into a grouped/suppressed actionable inbox with inline actions (approve, acknowledge, run automation). It ensures critical items prompt rapid action.  ￼

Primary functions
	•	Subscribed event streams, grouped/suppressed feed, exec email integration (for critical approvals), inline actions in cards, and suppression log for audit.  ￼

Who cares / importance
	•	On-call engineers and execs (via email) — notifications trigger the triage-to-action loop and prevent missed approvals / SLA breaches. High-impact for response time.  ￼

Data flows
	•	Subscribes to events; pushes grouped/suppressed state and action outcomes back to OpsHub/ITSM. Must integrate with push and email deep links.  ￼

Frontend UX responsibilities / acceptance
	•	Grouped inbox UI with inline action buttons, clear suppression indicators, deep-linking into WorkItem Detail, offline queueing for actions taken offline, and a suppression log viewer.  ￼

⸻

7) Cross-cutting: Sync & Conflict Center (offline governance)

What it does (purpose)
Central place to view pending offline actions, resolve conflicts (AI-assisted field-level merges), and see sync health. This is the safety valve when devices have been offline.  ￼

Primary functions
	•	WAL (Write-Ahead Log) view, per-action status, conflict resolution UI (local vs remote vs AI suggestion), and audit logging of decisions. Forced sync after 4 hours offline.  ￼

Who cares / importance
	•	Field engineers (who go offline), tenant admins (who monitor sync health), and compliance teams (need auditability). Critical to guarantee data integrity and governance.  ￼

Frontend UX responsibilities / acceptance
	•	Clear pending counters, per-action retry controls, conflict resolution flow with AI explainability and required reason capture for overrides. Show device & tenant-level sync telemetry.  ￼

⸻

8) Cross-cutting: AI & Automation Framework (UX & governance)

What it does (purpose)
Provides assistive AI agents (triager, approval advisor, RCA, automation advisor, knowledge curator) that operate within risk thresholds and always explain recommendations.  ￼

Primary functions
	•	Suggest category/prioritization, propose assignments (auto-assign if >85% confidence), recommend approve/reject with rationale, detect automation candidates and draft KB content. Collect feedback for model training.  ￼

Who cares / importance
	•	Drives adoption and ROI: helps engineers and SREs work faster, provides managers with risk context, and gives execs measurable automation outcomes. It’s the differentiator between OpsHub and classic overlays.  ￼

Frontend UX responsibilities / acceptance
	•	Every AI suggestion must show confidence %, top 3 contributing factors, model version and a “Why?” panel. UI must enforce governance thresholds (one-click for high confidence/low-risk, confirm dialog for medium risk, read-only for low confidence), and capture accept/reject reasons. All interactions logged for training & audit.  ￼

⸻

9) Non-functional & governance implications (frontend cues)
	•	Offline-first UX: 4-hour offline guarantee, visible offline badges, WAL pending counters, forced sync on reconnect.  ￼
	•	Audit & compliance: immutable logs for approvals, suppression, conflict resolutions — surfacing audit-friendly views in UI.  ￼
	•	Performance & accessibility: mobile targets (≤3s initial load on 3G, workitem open ≤1.5s cached), WCAG AA.  ￼
