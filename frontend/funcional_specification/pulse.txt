Pulse — Micro-Interaction Flows (Frontend-Only, MVP)

0 — Purpose

Pulse is the persona-based dashboard of OpsHub. It surfaces operational health and ROI with immutable, governed KPIs. It is read-only in Phase 1: all interactions are drill-downs into SmartQueue or Intelligence Center.

⸻

1 — Entry Points & Navigation
	•	Global nav: Pulse is always the first tab for all personas.
	•	Deep links: Notifications, SmartQueue, or Intelligence may link to Pulse widget context (e.g., SLA breach trend).
	•	Persona defaults: Engineer → personal Pulse; Manager → team Pulse; Exec → Exec Pulse.

⸻

2 — Layout & Widget Framework
	•	Grid layout: 2–4 columns desktop, 1 column mobile.
	•	Mandatory widgets: cannot be removed (e.g., SLA compliance, downtime cost avoided). Optional widgets: user can collapse/hide, but not delete.
	•	Widgets must show:
	1.	Header: Title + lastUpdated timestamp.
	2.	Metric: Primary value + unit.
	3.	Trend: sparkline or % delta vs baseline.
	4.	AI Forecast Badge: if AI-derived.
	5.	Why? control: shows top-3 drivers + modelVersion.
	6.	Drill-down CTA: “View items” → SmartQueue or Intelligence.

⸻

3 — Persona-Specific Widgets (Phase 1)

Engineer
	•	SLA streak (days) → gamified.
	•	Personal backlog (count, delta).
	•	“AI Helped Me” counter (tasks/time saved).

Manager
	•	Team SLA compliance %.
	•	Backlog aging histogram.
	•	Pending approvals count + SLA timers.

SRE
	•	Automation ROI (hours saved, rollback %).
	•	Recurring incident pattern widget.

SME
	•	Knowledge compliance % (reviews/retirements).
	•	AI-draft validation counter.

Executive
	•	Downtime cost avoided ($).
	•	SLA compliance trendline.
	•	AI/automation adoption %.

⸻

4 — Widget Micro-Interactions

4.1 SLA Streak Widget
	•	Shows streak days (e.g., “7 days met”).
	•	Visual: badge/medal icon.
	•	Tooltip: Streak resets on next SLA breach.
	•	On streak break: animate reset → show modal: SLA streak ended — breach on WorkItem <ID>.

4.2 AI Forecast Widgets
	•	Must display “AI Forecast” pill.
	•	Why? reveals top-3 drivers and modelVersion.
	•	Tooltip: Forecast generated by AI. Confidence: NN%.

4.3 Drill-down Interactions
	•	Clicking value or CTA:
	•	SLA widget → SmartQueue pre-filtered to SLA breaches.
	•	Automation ROI → Intelligence Automations tab.
	•	Knowledge compliance → SmartQueue Knowledge tab.
	•	Downtime cost avoided → Exec ROI dashboard in Intelligence.
	•	Preserve filter context (e.g., timeframe, team).

4.4 Gamification
	•	SLA streak: animated +1 per day, resets transparently.
	•	“AI Helped Me” counter: increments in real time when backend confirms AI assistance. Tooltip: Based on accepted AI recs logged.

⸻

5 — Error & Offline States
	•	Offline:
	•	Show cached snapshot with greyed-out timestamp: Last updated: <timestamp> (offline).
	•	Forecast widgets disabled with overlay: Forecast unavailable offline.
	•	API error:
	•	Widget shows Error loading data. Retry. button.
	•	Drill-down CTA disabled until data loaded.

⸻

6 — Accessibility
	•	Each widget must be focusable.
	•	Screen reader announces: Widget <Title>, Metric <value>, Trend <delta%>.
	•	“Why?” control labelled: Explain AI forecast for <Title>.
	•	Keyboard: Tab → focus widget, Enter → drill-down, Space → expand Why?.

⸻

7 — Telemetry Events
	•	pulse.open {persona, widgetCount}
	•	pulse.widget.view {widgetId, value, timestamp}
	•	pulse.widget.drilldown {widgetId, targetModule, filters}
	•	pulse.widget.explain_open {widgetId, modelVersion, confidence}
	•	pulse.gamification.increment {type: sla_streak|ai_helped, newValue}
	•	pulse.error {widgetId, errorCode}

⸻

8 — Acceptance Criteria
	•	AC-PU-01: All widgets show required fields (header, value, trend, updatedAt).
	•	AC-PU-02: AI Forecast widgets display badge + Why? with top-3 drivers + modelVersion.
	•	AC-PU-03: Drill-down CTAs preserve filters and open correct module.
	•	AC-PU-04: Mandatory widgets cannot be removed; optional widgets can be collapsed.
	•	AC-PU-05: SLA streak resets on breach and increments only on backend confirmation.
	•	AC-PU-06: Offline shows cached snapshot; forecasts disabled with overlay.
	•	AC-PU-07: Screen reader announces widget info correctly.
