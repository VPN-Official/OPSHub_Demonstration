OpsHub – Enterprise Operations Platform

Functional Specification v4.0 (Bible Copy – Section 0 & 1)

⸻

0. Vision & Principles

0.1 Vision

OpsHub exists to solve one of the biggest pain points in enterprise IT and operations:
fragmentation across 8–12 tools, leading to lost productivity, delayed resolutions, and lack of unified visibility.

Whereas traditional ITSM platforms like ServiceNow or Jira act as systems of record, OpsHub is the system of engagement and intelligence overlay.
	•	It consolidates data and workflows into one AI-native cockpit.
	•	It empowers engineers, managers, and executives to act faster, with more confidence.
	•	It introduces autonomous AI assistance (low-risk first, growing to higher-risk with guardrails).
	•	It is mobile-first and offline-capable, built for the real-world workflows of field engineers, cloud ops, app support, and command centers.

The promise: “OpsHub unifies operations, augments humans with AI, and drives measurable ROI by reducing toil, improving MTTR, and providing visibility from the engineer’s desk to the CIO’s dashboard.”

⸻

0.2 Design Principles
	1.	Overlay, Not Replacement
	•	OpsHub connects to ITSM, monitoring, and collaboration tools — it does not replace them.
	•	Example: Creating an incident in OpsHub → writes into ServiceNow (system of record), but managed through OpsHub thereafter.
	2.	AI-Native from Day 1
	•	Every module includes AI augmentation (recommendations, automation suggestions, explainability).
	•	Example: In SmartQueue, AI explains why a P2 item is scored higher than a P1 (due to SLA breach proximity).
	3.	Mobile-First, Offline-Ready
	•	Full PWA support with 4h offline capability.
	•	Example: A field engineer logs updates offline; OpsHub syncs with conflict arbitration when online.
	4.	Persona-First UX
	•	Each role gets tailored defaults (Engineer, Manager, SME, SRE, Exec).
	•	Example: Engineers see SLA streaks, while CIOs see downtime cost avoided.
	5.	Governance by Default
	•	SLA timers never pause.
	•	Approvals always logged with reasons.
	•	Suppressed notifications always recoverable via Suppression Log.
	6.	Explainability & Trust
	•	AI suggestions show confidence + top 3 factors.
	•	Example: “Restart Service X (92% confidence, based on 14 similar incidents resolved in <30 min).”
	7.	Continuous Improvement
	•	OpsHub doesn’t just show what happened; it shows how AI, automation, and teams can improve next.
	•	Example: Intelligence Center nudges → “Recurring task detected → suggest automation.”

⸻

0.3 Scope of Phase 1 (MVP)

In-Scope
	•	Multi-tenant architecture (single tenant view only).
	•	Core modules: Pulse, SmartQueue, WorkItem Detail, Intelligence Center, Schedule, Notifications.
	•	Incident creation (manual + from alerts).
	•	Low-risk automation execution (with rollback).
	•	AI explainability (confidence + top 3 factors).
	•	SLA governance, suppression log, conflict acceptance.
	•	Offline-first (4h max offline, arbitration at sync).
	•	ISO27001 + SOC2 readiness.

Out of Scope (Phase 2+)
	•	Cross-tenant / MSP views.
	•	Predictive “what-if” ROI analytics.
	•	Slack/MS Teams integration.
	•	Complex CAB workflows.
	•	Advanced automation designer.
	•	Custom Pulse widgets.

⸻

0.4 Success Anchors (End-State Vision)
	•	Engineer: “AI helped me fix 3 tickets today, I spent less time clicking, more time solving.”
	•	Manager: “My team’s SLA compliance is up 15%, escalations are down.”
	•	SRE: “We automated a recurring issue and eliminated 40h/month of toil.”
	•	SME: “AI flagged an outdated article; I updated it before it caused confusion.”
	•	CIO: “We avoided $200k in downtime last quarter, adoption is growing, and the team trusts AI.”

⸻

1. Executive Summary

1.1 Business Problem

Enterprise IT operations face systemic inefficiencies:
	•	Fragmented tools: Engineers toggle across ITSM, monitoring, comms, and KB tools → 40% productivity loss.

It consolidates:
	•	Engineer shifts and on-call rotations.
	•	Planned changes and maintenance windows.
	•	SLA deadlines and knowledge review/retirement tasks.
	•	Training and team meetings.

Unlike fragmented ITSM calendars, Schedule View is:
	•	AI-augmented (detects conflicts, workload imbalance).
	•	Governed (conflict acceptance requires reason, logged).
	•	Persona-aware (engineer, manager, SRE, SME, exec each see what matters to them).

⸻

Primary Functions

1. Unified Calendar of Events
	•	Event Types Supported in Phase 1:
	•	Team shifts (coverage planning, on-call duty).
	•	Planned changes (system modifications, deployments).
	•	Maintenance windows (downtime slots).
	•	SLA deadlines (e.g., incident due, approval SLA).
	•	Knowledge lifecycle deadlines (review/retirement).

3.6 Notifications — Awareness Backbone

Purpose

The Notifications module is the central awareness hub in OpsHub.
It ensures:
	•	No critical event (SLA breach, P0 incident, exec approval) is ever missed.
	•	Users get only relevant, role-based notifications.
	•	AI prevents noise via grouping/suppression — but with full transparency (Suppression Log).
	•	Approvals, nudges, and escalations can be acted on directly from the notification.

OpsHub Notifications = “the right signal, at the right time, to the right persona, with governance.”

⸻

Primary Functions

1. Centralized Inbox
	•	Categories (Phase 1):
	•	All → full feed of notifications.
	•	Critical → SLA breaches, P0/P1s, exec approvals.
	•	Grouped → related items bundled (e.g., “12 similar P3 alerts grouped”).
	•	Suppressed → auto-muted by AI (still visible here).
	•	Nudges → AI suggestions for automation, knowledge, or workload balancing.
	•	Sort & Filter: by severity, SLA time, work type, or persona relevance.
	•	Searchable: full-text search across notification log.

⸻

2. Delivery Channels
	•	In-App Feed (default): real-time updates with badge counters.
	•	Push Notifications (mobile PWA): bypass app for urgent alerts.
	•	Email (exec-only): critical incidents/approvals sent as digest or immediate alert.
	•	Explicitly Out of Scope Phase 1: SMS, Slack/Teams (reserved for Phase 2).

⸻

3. Grouping & Suppression
	•	Grouping: AI clusters notifications within a rolling 10-minute window.
	•	Example: “10 P3 incidents for Service A” → 1 grouped notification.
	•	Suppression: repetitive or low-value alerts muted automatically.
	•	Example: “50 identical CPU warnings suppressed → 1 summary created.”
	•	Suppression Log:
	•	Every suppressed item recorded immutably.
	•	Each entry includes original content, AI reasoning, suppression timestamp.
	•	Users can recover suppressed items manually.
	•	Tenant Admin sets retention (30–365 days).

⸻

4. Escalation Rules
	•	SLA-based checkpoints trigger escalation notifications:
	•	15 min before SLA breach.
	•	5 min before breach.
	•	At breach moment.
	•	Escalation Flow:
	•	Engineer → Manager → Exec (only for P0/P1 or critical approvals).
	•	All escalations logged in audit trail.
	•	Escalations cannot be silenced.

⸻

5. Inline Actions
	•	Users can act directly from notification cards:
	•	Approve/reject (with reason required on reject).
	•	Assign/reassign task.
	•	Trigger low-risk automation.
	•	Quick comment or mention.
	•	Dismiss (with undo option).

	•	Compliant with ITIL, ISO27001, SOC2.
	•	Transparent (no black boxes).
	•	Auditable (immutable logs, SLA enforcement).
	•	Safe (risk-tiering + rollback).
	•	Persona-aware (governance rules tailored to role).

Governance is not an overlay — it’s baked into every module.

⸻

Primary Governance Mechanisms

4.1 SLA Enforcement
	•	Immutable SLA Clocks
	•	SLA timers start when WorkItem created (incident, request, approval).
	•	SLA clocks never pause, even if item is rejected or reassigned.
	•	SLA breach = logged immutably with timestamp + responsible persona/team.
	•	Escalation Triggers
	•	Pre-breach warnings at T-15m and T-5m.
	•	Escalations flow upward: Engineer → Manager → Exec.
	•	Escalations cannot be suppressed.
	•	SLA Analytics
	•	On-time %, overdue %, escalations logged.
	•	Persona accountability tracked (e.g., Manager approval SLA = 88%).

⸻

4.2 Approvals Governance
	•	Unified Approvals in SmartQueue
	•	All approvals (changes, incidents, knowledge, automations) appear in one place.
	•	SLA clock shown on each approval.
	•	Decision Discipline
	•	Rejection requires reason (mandatory text field).
	•	Resubmission limited: Phase 1 = one resubmission allowed only.
	•	Approvals logged with user, timestamp, reason, SLA state.
	•	AI Approval Advisor
	•	AI provides recommendation with reasoning.
	•	If user rejects AI’s suggestion, rejection reason is captured and fed back into learning loop.
	•	Executive Approvals
	•	Delivered via email + deep link to WorkItem.
	•	Same governance rules apply (reason mandatory on rejection, SLA tracked).

⸻

4.3 Conflict Arbitration
	•	Applies to:
	•	Offline Sync Conflicts (two users edit same field offline).
	•	Schedule Conflicts (overlapping changes, shifts, maintenance windows).
	•	Assignment Conflicts (cross-team escalations).
	•	Arbitration Flow
	•	AI suggests resolution (e.g., “merge field A, keep field B”).
	•	User/manager makes final call.
	•	Resolution logged with reason.
	•	Conflict Acceptance
	•	Users/managers can accept unresolved conflict with explicit reason.
	•	Accepted conflicts tagged as “Acknowledged” → stop nagging, but remain in audit logs.

⸻

4.4 Automation Governance
	•	Risk-Tiering
	•	Automations categorized as Low / Medium / High.
	•	Low-risk → auto-executable inline by engineer.
	•	Medium-risk → requires manager approval.
	•	High-risk → requires multi-level approval.
	•	Rollback Policy
	•	Rollback availability explicitly flagged before execution.
	•	Automations without rollback → medium/high risk by default.
	•	Execution Logging
	•	Every automation run logged: who, when, risk level, outcome, rollback status.
	•	Rollback runs logged separately.
	•	ROI Tracking
	•	Toil hours saved calculated at execution.
	•	Rollback % tracked → auto-flags automation for review if >10%.

⸻

4.5 AI Governance
	•	Explainability by Default
	•	Every AI suggestion shows confidence % + top 3 contributing factors.
	•	Example: “Restart Service X (92% confidence, based on 14 similar incidents resolved in <30m).”
	•	Human-in-the-Loop
	•	Low-risk recs → auto-executed if confidence >85%.
	•	Medium/high-risk recs → human confirmation required.
	•	All rejections logged with reason.
	•	Learning Validation
	•	AI never updates its decision logic silently.
	•	New patterns flagged → require human confirmation before adoption.
	•	Bias & Fairness Checks
	•	Adoption/rejection rates monitored across personas/teams.
	•	Outliers flagged (e.g., “Team A rejects 90% of AI recs → investigate bias or model gap”).

⸻

4.6 Notifications & Suppression Governance
	•	Transparency Principle
	•	No notification is ever deleted.
	•	Suppressed items visible in Suppression Log.
	•	Suppression Log Contents
	•	Original notification.
	•	AI reasoning for suppression.
	•	Suppression timestamp.
	•	Recovery option.

	•	Critical escalations (P0/P1, SLA breaches) cannot be suppressed or dismissed.

⸻

4.7 War Room Governance
	•	War rooms created for major incidents.
	•	Participation logged (who joined, duration).
	•	All chat + actions linked to WorkItem Activity Log.
	•	War room closed only when incident resolved.

⸻

Governance by Persona
	•	Engineer: cannot bypass SLA; automation runs logged.
	•	Manager: must give reason for conflict acceptance; SLA approval compliance tracked.
	•	SRE: automation rollback >10% auto-flags review.
	•	SME: knowledge retirement requires explicit approval/reason.
	•	Executive: approvals logged like others; SLA applies equally.

⸻

Phase 1 vs Phase 2

Phase 1 (MVP)
	•	SLA clocks (immutable, no pause).
	•	Escalations (Engineer → Manager → Exec).
	•	Approval governance (reason mandatory, resubmission once).
	•	Conflict arbitration (offline/schedule).
	•	Automation risk-tiering + rollback rules.
	•	AI explainability + rejection reasons logged.
	•	Suppression log (immutable, recoverable).
	•	War room logging.

Phase 2+
	•	Predictive SLA enforcement (“likely to breach → escalate early”).
	•	Multi-tenant/global governance views.
	•	Policy-as-code for automation governance.
	•	AI fairness dashboards.
	•	Legal/compliance sign-off workflows.

5. AI & Automation Framework

Purpose

The AI & Automation Framework makes OpsHub an AI-native overlay platform instead of a traditional ITSM dashboard.
It ensures:
	•	AI is pervasive but safe — present in every module, with explainability.
	•	Automations are governed and ROI-tracked — not black-box scripts.
	•	AI agents augment humans (triage, routing, RCA, approvals), but stay within risk boundaries.
	•	Continuous learning → OpsHub improves as adoption grows.

⸻

5.1 AI Design Principles
	1.	Assistive First, Agentic Where Safe
	•	Phase 1 AI = assistive with low-risk autonomy (routing, triage, diagnostics, low-risk automation).
	•	Always explainable → “Why this?” visible everywhere.
	2.	Human-in-the-Loop
	•	Medium/high-risk actions always require human approval.
	•	Humans remain ultimate decision-makers.
	3.	Explainability Everywhere
	•	Every AI suggestion includes:
	•	Confidence %.
	•	Top 3 factors.
	•	Historical precedent (e.g., “14 similar incidents resolved in <30m”).
	4.	Feedback-Driven Learning
	•	All acceptance/rejection of AI recs logged with reasons.
	•	Feedback loops feed into model retraining.
	5.	Governed Autonomy
	•	Thresholds (confidence %, risk level) define what AI can execute vs recommend.
	•	Governance rules (Section 4) enforce compliance.

⸻

5.2 AI Agent Types (Phase 1)
	•	Incident Triager
	•	Reads alert payloads, suggests incident categorization + priority.
	•	Auto-assigns to best-fit engineer if confidence >85%.
	•	Else → suggests top 3 options.
	•	Approval Advisor
	•	Provides recommendation (approve/reject) with risk context.
	•	Example: “Change overlaps with maintenance window → recommend reject.”
	•	Decision rationale logged.
	•	Root Cause Assistant
	•	Analyzes logs in WorkItem.
	•	Suggests likely RCA with confidence score.
	•	Links to similar past incidents + KB.
	•	Automation Advisor
	•	Detects recurring manual actions.
	•	Suggests existing automation or flags new candidate.
	•	Pushes candidate nudges into Intelligence Center.
	•	Knowledge Curator
	•	Drafts KB articles from resolved incidents.
	•	Flags outdated/ineffective articles.
	•	Requires SME validation before publish/retire.

5.3 AI Governance (Phase 1)
	•	Confidence Thresholds
	•	85% confidence + Low risk → AI executes autonomously.
	•	60–85% confidence → AI suggests, requires human approval.
	•	<60% confidence → AI only provides insights, not recommendations.
	•	Rejections
	•	Rejection always requires reason → logged for learning loop.
	•	Bias Detection
	•	Adoption/rejection tracked by persona/team.
	•	Outliers flagged (e.g., “Team A rejects 90% → investigate bias/model gap”).
	•	Auditability
	•	Every AI decision stored with:
	•	Model version.
	•	Input factors.
	•	Confidence %.
	•	Final human decision.

⸻

5.4 Automation Framework
	•	Automation Types Supported
	•	Scripts (e.g., clear cache).
	•	Workflows (multi-step tasks).
	•	Integration tasks (data sync).
	•	Communication tasks (notify stakeholders).
	•	Risk-Tiering
	•	Low: reversible, low business impact → auto-run allowed.
	•	Medium: some risk, requires manager approval.
	•	High: critical impact, requires multi-level approval.
	•	Rollback Governance
	•	Automations tagged as Rollback Available: Yes/No.
	•	No rollback → automatically medium/high risk.
	•	Rollback runs logged as separate events.
	•	Execution Visibility
	•	Real-time progress indicators.
	•	Logs stored in WorkItem Activity Log.
	•	Failures + rollbacks auto-flagged in Intelligence Center.
	•	ROI Tracking
	•	Each run tagged with “toil hours saved” estimate.
	•	Aggregated into Pulse + Intelligence Center.
	•	Example: “Cache clear script saved 20h toil this week.”

⸻

5.5 Continuous Learning Framework
	•	Learning Sources
	•	User feedback (thumbs up/down, explicit rejection reasons).
	•	SLA outcomes (AI rec accepted → SLA met faster?).
	•	Automation success/failure + rollback %.
	•	Knowledge helpfulness ratings.
	•	Retraining Cadence
	•	Feedback aggregated weekly.
	•	Model retraining → tested in shadow mode before rollout.

9. Integration Architecture

Purpose

OpsHub acts as an aggregation and orchestration layer over existing enterprise tools.
Instead of replacing ITSM, monitoring, or HR systems, OpsHub connects, synchronizes, and augments them with:
	•	Unified UI (SmartQueue, Pulse, Notifications).
	•	AI-driven insights (triage, RCA, automation, nudges).
	•	Bidirectional sync so source systems remain systems of record.

⸻

9.1 Integration Principles
	1.	Non-Disruptive Overlay
	•	OpsHub integrates without requiring replacement or migration.
	•	ServiceNow, Jira, Datadog, etc. remain source of truth.
	2.	API-First Approach
	•	All integrations use APIs, webhooks, or message queues.
	•	No direct DB connections.
	3.	Configurable Authority
	•	Per data type, one system is marked “authoritative” (e.g., ITSM for incidents).
	•	OpsHub writes back only where allowed.
	4.	Real-Time Where It Matters
	•	SLA-driven fields (status, assignment, approvals) sync in near real-time (<30s).
	•	Reference data (users, catalog) syncs hourly/daily.
	5.	Conflict Transparency
	•	All conflicts surfaced to user with both versions.
	•	Arbitration logged with reasoning.

⸻

9.2 Supported Integration Patterns
	•	REST APIs → standard integration with modern SaaS (ServiceNow, Jira, Datadog).
	•	Webhooks → push notifications (incident created, alert triggered).
	•	Message Queues → asynchronous high-volume feeds (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
	•	File-Based → batch import/export for legacy systems (CSV, flat files).

⸻

9.3 Target System Categories (Phase 1 Scope)
	•	ITSM Systems
	•	ServiceNow.
	•	Jira Service Management.
	•	Remedy (basic via APIs).
	•	Monitoring & Observability
	•	Datadog.
	•	Splunk.
	•	New Relic.
	•	Prometheus.

	•	Email (SMTP/IMAP for exec approvals + digests).
	•	In-app chat (native).
	•	Phase 2: Slack / Microsoft Teams.
	•	HR & Workforce Systems
	•	HR system (leave calendars, read-only Phase 1).
	•	Directory (user sync, roles).
	•	Custom/Legacy Apps
	•	File-based batch sync (nightly jobs).
	•	Custom API connectors.

⸻

9.4 Sync & Conflict Resolution

A. Sync Strategy
	•	Critical Data → <30s sync (incident status, SLA timers).
	•	Important Data → <2 min sync (work item details).
	•	Reference Data → hourly/daily sync (user directory, service catalog).

B. Conflict Resolution
	•	User Arbitration → user sees “OpsHub vs Source” versions.
	•	Field-Level Merge → pick field-by-field resolution.
	•	AI Recommendation → suggested resolution with top 3 reasons.
	•	Audit Logging → chosen resolution logged immutably.

C. Authority Rules
	•	ITSM = authoritative for incidents, requests, changes.
	•	Monitoring = authoritative for logs, metrics, alerts.
	•	HR = authoritative for shifts, leave, training.
	•	OpsHub = authoritative for AI scores, SmartQueue ordering, nudges.

⸻

9.5 Service Catalog Integration
	•	Phase 1 Scope
	•	OpsHub integrates with existing service catalog (no local copy).
	•	Real-time lookups only (always fresh).
	•	Used in SmartQueue and WorkItem Detail.
	•	Relationship Mapping
	•	Dependencies shown as graph view.
	•	Inline relationship panels in WorkItem.
	•	Impact Analysis
	•	AI calculates likely business impact if service degraded.

	•	Conflict resolution workflow governed.
	•	Phase 1 vs 2 scoped cleanly.

⸻

10. Mobile & Offline Architecture

Purpose

OpsHub is mobile-first: many operational users (field engineers, NOC, on-call staff) must be able to do real work from phones/tablets with unreliable connectivity. The Mobile & Offline Architecture guarantees the same operational capabilities on-device as on desktop for Phase 1 core flows (view, triage, act, create incident from alert, approve low-risk items), while ensuring safe, auditable synchronization when connectivity returns.

⸻

10.1 High-Level Principles
	1.	PWA as Primary Mobile Delivery
	•	OpsHub ships as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with installable behavior (home screen icon, splash), full-screen UX, and push notifications.
	2.	Feature Parity (Behavioral)
	•	Mobile supports the same functional workflows as desktop for core tasks: SmartQueue (My Work), WorkItem Detail, creating incidents from alerts, approvals (low/medium per governance), running low-risk automations, Notifications, and the ability to access cached Pulse widgets and Knowledge articles.
	3.	Offline-First, Sync-Safe
	•	Local-first read/write in offline mode with queued sync on reconnect, conflict detection & arbitration, and prioritized sync for critical items.
	4.	Security & Device Trust
	•	Device registration, certificate pinned sessions, MFA for privileged actions, and ability for Tenant Admins to revoke device access.
	5.	Performance Constraints
	•	Fast initial load and snappy navigation on mobile networks (Phase 1 targets: initial load ≤3s on 3G simulated; subsequent navigation ≤1s).

⸻

10.2 Supported Mobile Scenarios (Phase 1)

Full support (offline-capable, read/write queued):
	•	View SmartQueue “My Work” and card actions.
	•	Open WorkItem Detail (cached snapshot + essential tabs).
	•	Create Incident from Alert (form pre-fill from cached alert) — writes queued if offline, pushed to ITSM on sync.
	•	Approve low-risk automations and approve medium-risk (if governance allows offline approvals advisory only — see rules).
	•	Add status updates, comments, attachments (photo/video), and perform Assign to Me.
	•	Access Knowledge articles (cached for offline read).
	•	Receive push notifications (critical only / per user prefs).
	•	Offline capture of photos, notes, GPS metadata attached to updates.

Read-only or advisory offline:
	•	Approve medium/high-risk automations (advisory: queued but requires online confirmation for enforcement).
	•	View full Pulse (cached widgets; live-only forecasts disabled).
	•	Access System Logs (snapshot only, no streaming).

⸻

10.3 Data Model & Local Storage

Local Storage Layers:
	1.	Index DB (primary local DB)
	•	Stores structured WorkItem metadata, queue state, forms in progress, user actions queued. Encrypted at rest.
	2.	Cache Layer (read-heavy)
	•	Cached Pulse widget snapshots, Knowledge article content, recent WorkItem details, and AI sidebar summaries.
	3.	Attachment Storage
	•	Pending attachments (photos, videos) stored in local encrypted blob storage and linked to queued updates.
	4.	Action Queue
	•	Append-only WAL (write-ahead log) of user actions (updates, assignments, approvals, attachments). Each action stored with GUID, timestamp, device id, user id, and dependency pointers.

Data Lifetimes:
	•	Local cache TTL configurable per tenant; default 7 days for large dataset elements, 30 days for personal items.
	•	Attachments persisted locally until successful upload and confirmation from ITSM.

Storage Security:
	•	Encrypt local DB & blobs using tenant-specific keys; keys managed by secure enclave where available (platform keychain/HSM).
	•	Local data wiped on sign-out, device revoke, or after configured inactivity window.

⸻

10.4 Offline Workflows & Sync Behavior

Principles:
	•	Authoritative Writes: On sync, authoritative system wins per Data Authority config — OpsHub writes where allowed; otherwise OpsHub requests change via API and reconciles responses.
	•	Prioritized Sync Queue: On reconnect, items synced in priority order:
	1.	SLA-critical updates (items near breach)
	2.	Approvals (if online-confirmed)
	3.	Incident creations from alerts
	4.	Status updates and comments
	5.	Attachments & large payloads
	•	Transactional Batching: Batch commits to source systems to reduce API pressure; commit records include device id & action GUIDs for traceability.

Conflict Detection:
	•	Compare field-level versions by vector clocks and timestamps.
	•	If remote change exists for same field: flag a conflict event in local UI and in server sync response.

Conflict Resolution Flow:
	1.	Automatic Safe-Merge: If non-overlapping fields → merge automatically.
	2.	AI-Suggested Merge: If overlapping but rule-based (e.g., timestamps, higher-priority field owners) → AI proposes choice with confidence.
	3.	User Arbitration: If ambiguity remains, present both versions to user (side-by-side) with:
	•	Proposed resolution selected,
	•	Button to keep local, keep remote, or field-level merge.
	•	Mandatory reason capture if user overrides AI suggestion.
	4.	Audit Logging: All resolution decisions logged immutably with device id, user id, timestamps, and reasoning.

Offline Approval Rules (Phase 1):
	•	Low-risk approvals accepted offline are queued and executed on sync; unless governance requires online verification. When governance requires, the offline approval is treated as advisory and visually marked “Pending Online Confirmation.”
	•	Rejection reasons must be filled in; can be queued offline.

⸻

10.5 Attachments & Media Handling
	•	Camera Integration: Support in mobile UI for attaching photos/video with metadata (timestamp, device GPS — if user consents).
	•	Compression & Optimization: Client compresses images for upload; retains original until server confirms receipt.
	•	Secure Upload: Uploads use pre-signed URLs with limited TTL; multipart uploads for large files.
	•	Attachment Audit: Each attachment transfer logged; if upload fails after retries, user notified with retry options.

⸻

10.6 Push Notifications & Background Sync

Push Channels (Phase 1):
	•	Web Push for PWA (critical items and user preferences respected).
	•	Push message carries minimal payload (title, workitem id, priority) — full payload fetched on open to reduce on-wire data.

Notification Behavior:
	•	Critical notifications bypass “quiet hours” if user configured emergency override.
	•	Non-critical grouped notifications are collapsed; users can expand in-app.

Background Sync:
	•	Periodic background sync attempts (OS-limited).
	•	When background sync occurs, only lightweight syncs for high-priority items to preserve battery. Full sync performed when app in foreground or user-triggered.

⸻

10.7 Mobile UX & Interaction Patterns (Phase 1)

Design Guidelines (mobile-first UX):
	•	Minimal information density on first view; progressive disclosure for details.
	•	Minimum 44px touch targets.
	•	Swipe gestures for quick actions (assign to me, quick comment).
	•	Long-press for contextual actions (reassign, escalate).
	•	Pull-to-refresh for manual sync + visual sync status indicator.
	•	On offline state, every actionable control shows offline icon and queued state if user acts.

Key Mobile Screens (Phase 1):
	1.	SmartQueue – My Work (Card View)
	•	Prioritized cards with SLA countdown, short description, quick actions (Assign, Approve, Run Automation).
	2.	WorkItem Detail (Mobile)
	•	Condensed header (ID, status, SLA). Tabs accessible via horizontal swipe (Details, Activity, AI, Attachments).
	•	AI recommendations shown at top of sidebar area (tappable for full detail).
	3.	Create Incident (Alert Flow)
	•	Pre-filled form, minimal mandatory fields, photo attach, submit button (queued if offline).
	4.	Notifications Inbox
	•	Grouped view with inline actions.
	5.	Sync & Conflict Center
	•	Single-screen dashboard for pending sync actions and conflicts requiring arbitration.

10.8 Device Management & Security Controls

Device Registration & Trust:
	•	Device registration during first login with OAuth/SAML handshake.
	•	Device fingerprint (OS, app version, device id) stored for Tenant Admin visibility.
	•	MFA required for device registration for privileged users.

Device Revocation & Lost Device:
	•	Tenant Admin can revoke device access instantly; local data remotely invalidated / encryption keys revoked on next check.
	•	Mobile app polls for revocation on network; if device revoked, app forces logout and optionally wipes local cache.

Data Leakage Protections:
	•	Copy/paste restrictions configurable for attachments/fields flagged as sensitive.
	•	Optional data entry blocks for devices without encryption hardware.

⸻

10.9 Performance Targets & Monitoring (Mobile)

Phase 1 Targets (mobile experience):
	•	Initial load time ≤3 seconds on 3G simulated (first meaningful paint & interactive).
	•	List navigation (SmartQueue paging) ≤1 second.
	•	WorkItem open time ≤1.5 seconds with cached data; if online, fetch latest diff in background.
	•	Attachment capture & local save <2s.

Monitoring:
	•	Mobile telemetry includes offline session duration, sync success rate, conflict rate per device, battery impact metrics.
	•	Intelligence Center surfaces mobile health (e.g., “20% of field sessions experience sync errors”).

⸻

10.10 Edge Cases & Failure Modes

Network Flapping (Intermittent Connectivity):
	•	Exponential backoff for sync retries.
	•	User-facing warnings after repeated failures with suggested actions (e.g., “Switch to full Wi-Fi to upload attachments”).

Partial Writes / Partial Success:
	•	If batch sync partially succeeds, OpsHub marks individual action GUIDs success/failure. Failed actions re-queued with retry counters and admin notification after repeated failures.

Conflicting Schema Changes (ITSM Fields Changed Remote):
	•	OpsHub detects schema mismatch on sync; blocks write; surfaces admin task to reconcile schema differences; logs event for Tenant Admin.

Storage Constraints on Device:
	•	If local storage low, app alerts user and purges oldest non-critical caches (respecting user preferences). Attachments not uploaded are prioritized for immediate retry on reconnect.

	•	Device posture checks (MDM integration) and conditional access.
	•	Offline machine learning inference for AI recs on-device (for low-latency triage).

⸻

10.12 Audit & Compliance Hooks (Mobile)
	•	All mobile-originated actions include device id and offline flag in audit logs.
	•	Attachments captured offline flagged with metadata (GPS consent, timestamp) for compliance.
	•	Tenant-level config to disable GPS or attachment capture for privacy-sensitive customers.

⸻

10.13 Developer & QA Readiness (Mobile)

Developer APIs & SDKs:
	•	Client-side sync SDK (JS) with clear contracts for action queue, conflict resolution, and local storage encryption APIs.
	•	Telemetry SDK for mobile metrics collection.

QA Focus Areas:
	•	Offline action queue correctness across webview restarts.
	•	Conflict scenarios across multiple devices.
	•	Large-attachment compression & retry behaviors.
	•	Security tests for device revocation & key rotation.

⸻

10.14 Example Mobile Flow (Bus-Proof Illustration)

Scenario: Field engineer receives push P1 → acts offline → syncs on return.
	1.	Push arrives: brief card with WorkItem ID.
	2.	Engineer opens PWA (cached WorkItem).
	3.	Runs low-risk automation (client queues action in WAL with GUID).
	4.	Adds status update and takes photo attachment. WAL now has three entries: automation-run, status-update, attachment-upload.
	5.	Engineer goes into area with no coverage, continues work.
	6.	After 2 hours, connects to Wi-Fi: client initiates prioritized sync.
	•	Sends automation-run first (server confirms run executed; automation outcome logged).
	•	Sends status update next (server accepts and updates ITSM).
	•	Uploads attachment via pre-signed URL; server attaches it to WorkItem.
	•	Server returns any remote changes — conflict detected on assignment field.
	7.	Client presents conflict to engineer with AI suggestion: keep remote assignment (manager reassign) or override local. Engineer accepts remote.
	8.	All actions and conflict resolution are logged immutably with device id and timestamps.

11. Humanoid Integration

Purpose

OpsHub extends beyond software-only automation to controlled interaction with humanoid robots (field service assistants). This enables physical tasks (reset hardware, swap AV cables, press buttons) under OpsHub governance.

11.1 Principles
	•	Controlled Environment Only: no open-field autonomy in Phase 1.
	•	Low-Risk Only: humanoids execute scripts classified as low-risk with rollback (e.g., reboot/reset, physical plug cycle).
	•	Human Supervision: first execution always requires human sign-off.
	•	Audit-First: humanoid interactions logged like automations (device id, operator id, rollback state).

11.2 Phase 1 Capabilities
	•	Triggered by WorkItem: engineer in SmartQueue runs automation → humanoid executes pre-mapped script.
	•	Feedback Loop: humanoid reports completion status (success/failure).
	•	Attachment Support: humanoid sends back sensor photos/video to WorkItem Activity Log.
	•	Governance:
	•	Requires engineer confirmation before run.
	•	Rollback steps mandatory if available.
	•	SLA tracking continues.

11.3 Example Flow (AV Engineer)
	1.	Alert triggers incident in SmartQueue (panel not responding).
	2.	Engineer opens WorkItem → AI suggests “reset AV panel” (low risk).
	3.	Engineer clicks Execute via Humanoid.
	4.	Humanoid carries out reset, streams back confirmation image.
	5.	OpsHub logs execution, SLA clock continues.

11.4 Phase 2+ Expansion
	•	Multi-Humanoid Orchestration (multiple robots per incident).
	•	Semi-Autonomous Field Ops (routine inspections).
	•	Predictive Dispatch (AI flags pattern → humanoid pre-assigned task).
	•	Integration with MSP scenarios (global remote ops).
