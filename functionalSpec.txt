- **Performance Under Load**: Thorough load testing, auto-scaling implementation, performance monitoring

**Operational Risks**:
- **User Adoption Resistance**: Comprehensive change management, extensive training, gradual rollout
- **Data Migration Challenges**: Parallel operation during transition, data validation, rollback procedures
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security assessments, penetration testing, automated vulnerability scanning

**Business Risks**:
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Open standards adoption, API-first architecture, data portability planning
- **Scalability Limitations**: Cloud-native design, horizontal scaling architecture, performance monitoring
- **Compliance Failures**: Regular compliance audits, automated compliance checking, legal review processes
